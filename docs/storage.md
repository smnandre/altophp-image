# Storage

Use `save()` for one caller-selected path. Use a store for deterministic,
signature-keyed derivative paths and cache reuse.

## Save one image

```php
use Alto\Image\Image;

$result = Image::open('photo.jpg')
    ->cover(800, 450)
    ->webp(80)
    ->save('public/hero.webp');
```

The write is atomic on the local filesystem. `Result::$path` contains the saved
path.

## Use the local store

Passing a directory is the shortest form:

```php
$result = Image::open('photo.jpg')
    ->cover(800, 450)
    ->webp(80)
    ->store('public/media');
```

Create a `LocalStore` when the application also needs the path, cache status,
locking, or pruning:

```php
use Alto\Image\Image;
use Alto\Image\Store\LocalStore;

$store = new LocalStore('public/media');
$image = Image::open('photo.jpg')->cover(800, 450)->webp(80);

$path = $store->path($image);
$exists = $store->has($image);
$result = $store->ensureOne($image);
$removed = $store->prune(new DateTimeImmutable('-30 days'));
```

Path calculation uses source and request signatures. It does not decode pixels.
Local writes use a temporary file and atomic rename.

## Prevent duplicate work

Pass a critical-section closure when several workers may generate the same
derivative. It receives a stable key and the rendering closure:

```php
$store = new LocalStore(
    'public/media',
    criticalSection: fn (string $key, Closure $work) => $lock->run($key, $work),
);
```

The lock implementation belongs to the application so it can use the existing
process, cache, or distributed-lock infrastructure.

## Use Flysystem

```php
use Alto\Image\Store\FlysystemStore;

$store = new FlysystemStore($filesystem, prefix: 'media');
$results = $set->store($store);
```

`$filesystem` must implement `League\Flysystem\FilesystemOperator`. Flysystem
stores use adapter writes rather than local atomic rename. Files are written
with public visibility and the encoded MIME type.

Custom backends implement `StoreInterface`. See
[Extension contracts](api/extension-contracts.md).

## When saving fails

Check that the destination's parent can be created and written by the PHP
process. Local writes need space for a temporary file and an atomic rename;
a read-only directory or an existing directory at the file path cannot be a
valid destination. Check storage permissions and free space before retrying.
For remote stores, check adapter credentials and write permissions separately
from image decoding. See [exception contracts](api/exceptions.md).
